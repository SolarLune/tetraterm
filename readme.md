# TetraTerm üñ•Ô∏è

**TetraTerm** is a terminal-based debugging app for Tetra3D games and applications. It features a node graph, easy visualization of node properties, and means to create, modify, and delete nodes with minimal modifications to your game. It works by hooking into your game using networking; this means your game can crash or be interrupted and you can debug as you would like, while TetraTerm continues without issue and will re-connect when possible.

## How to use

The general approach to make this easiest to use would be to do as follows:

Firstly, run `go get github.com/solarlune/tetraterm`. This downloads `tetraterm` so you can create a server for your game project.

2. Run `go install github.com/solarlune/tetraterm/terminal`

3. Create a `Server` instance in your game and update it every frame.
4. Run the game.
5. Run `tetraterm` in a terminal. It should automatically read your game while it's running and connect to your game process via port 8000 to your game.
